# Crate Flickr Feed

This project uses AngularJS to create a single page application that displays a list of recent flickr images using the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/) and provides a mechanism to allow users to search by tag.

## Build & development

Install packages via `npm install` on the root.
Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
